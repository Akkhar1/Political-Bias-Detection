# Political News Bias Detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

## Project Bio

This project aims to detect political bias in news articles using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**. The model leverages **BERT embeddings** for text and entities, and a **GNN** for classification. The goal is to classify news articles as **neutral**, **left-leaning**, or **right-leaning** based on their content and relationships with entities (e.g., people, organizations).

### Key Components
- **BERT Embeddings**: Used to represent text and entities.
- **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**: Used to model relationships between articles and entities.
- **Dataset**: Political news articles labeled with bias categories.
